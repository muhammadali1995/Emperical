     * Bucket -> a data type that groups objects together
     * the term is often used when discussing hashing algorithms where different items that have
     * the same hash code (has collision) go into the same "bucket". Meaning the objects are grouped by the hash
     *
     * In general, a hashing function may map several different keys to the same index. Therefore, each slot of a
     * hash table is associated with (implicitly or explicitly) a set of records, rather than a single record.
     * For this reason, each slot of a hash table is often called a bucket, and hash values are also called bucket
     * indices.
